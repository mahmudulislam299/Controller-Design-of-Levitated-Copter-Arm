# Controller-Design-of-Levitated-Copter-Arm
The aim of this project is to design and implement an intelligent, efficient
and accurate P, PD, PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) controller of levitated
arm. The purpose of this report is to describe the P, PD PID controllerâ€™s. It
provides an insight into the background information related to P, PD,PID
controller
